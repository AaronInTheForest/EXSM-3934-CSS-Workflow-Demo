PROJECT SETUP
#	Create Styles folder and stylesheet
#	Add links to stylesheet (reset, layout, type, styles)
#	bg color = red to test connection

LAYOUT AND MOBILE FIRST RESPONSIVENESS
	MOBILE LAYOUT
#	Use mobile emulator for your first design!!!
#	display: grid on body
		https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/complete-guide-grid/
#	Set template
#	Define grid areas (with clown colours to help see the layout on the page)
	DESKTOP LAYOUT SETUP
#	Insert metadata tag
#	Create media query and use clown colour to test that it works
	DESKTOP LAYOUT
#	Redo template-areas
#	Redo column measurements
#	Wrap groups of multiple figures in <div class="fig-container"> so we can flex. Individual ones can be sized to fit later
#	Set flex-wrap, justify-content, and <div class="fig-container"> width (desktop only - mobile can't fit side-by-side images well enough)
#	On .fig-container figures set width to 30% to get pieces into their own mini-grids.
BACKGROUNDS
#	Set html bg color to something warm and article bg color to off-white (to have easier contrast with the off-black we're going to use for the text)
TYPOGRAPHY
#	Create new typography script with clown colours to see if it's hooked up right.
#	Remove the clown colours and pick something nice. https://color.adobe.com/create/image and used a painting to get a nice pallet
#	I do a lot of back and forth with typography because I find it to be finicky, 
#	but I still try to work from most-general to most-specific starting with body paragraph text then working up to headings.
#	For the body text I grabbed Open sans condensed because I felt the tightly packed letters felt frantic like Van Gogh's paint stroke style
#	Increased size for headers and gave whitespace to h2
#	Chose new font for h1 and h2, changed h1 colour and added a bg shadow layer to give better visual contrast.
#	Added margin-left on aside and nav for mobile version. It's not good to have two columns but I wanted to show it as an option.
#	Changed colours for links and hover state of links.	
#	Switched to DESKTOP mode
#		Increased body font-size to 1.2em based on the character count
#		Increased the font size by a lot - 12em total
#		Adjusted the tag line after the header to make it less noticeable - .75 em with no margins
# Went back to the layout and added some whitespace around ul, and indented the not-first-child of ul so it looks more like a hierarchy of headings.
VISUAL ELEMENTS, SPECIAL CASES, DETAILS, AND ONE-OFFS
#	This is the time to start getting picky with the little things. 
#	This part is where most people seem to start on, 
	but I think you will find it much easier now that you have the broad strokes.
#	Removed whitespace from figcaption p and added it to the figure to group things more tightly
